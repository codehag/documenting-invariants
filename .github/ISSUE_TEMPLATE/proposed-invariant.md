about: Propose an invariant (a feature of a language that should not be changed)
title: 'Invariant: <Title>'
labels: ''
assignees: codehag

## Quick facts

* Title: <!-- Title -->
* Must or should? <!-- pick one. if there are violations that can not be restricted to a well defined portion of the spec (such as use-strict) then this will be a should. If this is a new constraint that should be respected in the future, or it cannot be recorded in the specification, create a design principle. -->

## Long form description
<!-- add long form description of the invariant, what it is used for, possibly with samples -->

## Motivation
<!-- Why do we want to defend this invariant? What property does it give to a program that would be lost if it is broken or removed? -->

## Known Violations
<!-- this invariant may be true in only a subset of the language, for example strict mode -->

## Impacted parts of the specification
<!-- Which parts of the specification enable this invariant? Which ones possibly break it? -->
